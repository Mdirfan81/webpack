    <!-- <script src="./src/hello-world.js"></script> -->

    <!-- If using the webpack we need to provide the bundler js file name -->

<!-- Problem: Here having 2 file for JS, namly index.js
and hello-world.js in the hello-word.js I have written a function
console.log("Hello World") msg to print.
and calling the function in another file.

-->
<!-- if you put index.js file first
it will give you a error
ERR: function is not defined
-->

<!-- But if we call hello-world.js file first it will give 
the output by consling the output : Hello World
-->

<!-- We need to remember this order or it will give us the error
so solving this problem we make use of the webpack

for bundaling all the files.
-->
<!-- WEBPACK    can manage all those dependencies for us and
convernienlty bundle them into a single JS bundle that includes
all the code needed for the application.
 ==> npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

 webpack => is the main package to run it
 webpack-cli => used to run it using the terminal, it also needed

npx webpack 
npx webpack --stats detailed => this shows the details like
EntryPoint, assest etc
-->
